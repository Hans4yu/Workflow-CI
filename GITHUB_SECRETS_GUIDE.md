   - `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI`: URL to your MLflow server
   - `MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME`: Username for MLflow authentication
   - `MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD`: Password for MLflow authentication

2. **Docker Hub Authentication (for pushing Docker images)**
   - `DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
   - `DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN`: Your Docker Hub access token
