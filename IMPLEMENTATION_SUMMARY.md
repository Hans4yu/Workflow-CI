# CI Workflow Implementation Summary

## Requirements Fulfilled

This implementation fulfills the **Kriteria 3** requirements for setting up a CI workflow using MLflow Projects for automated model retraining. The implementation includes:

1. **MLflow Project Structure:**
   - Created MLProject file with entry points
   - Set up conda.yaml with appropriate dependencies
   - Adapted modelling.py for CI workflow
   - Added preprocessed dataset

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow:**
   - Configured workflow for automatic and manual triggers
   - Set up environment and dependencies
   - Implemented MLflow project execution
   - Added artifact upload and storage

3. **Docker Integration (Advanced Level):**
   - Created Dockerfile for model deployment
   - Implemented model serving API
   - Set up Docker Hub publishing
   - Added Docker Hub link documentation

## Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `MLProject/MLProject` | Defines MLflow project structure and entry points |
| `MLProject/conda.yaml` | Specifies environment dependencies |
| `MLProject/modelling.py` | Adapted script for CI workflow model training |
| `MLProject/loanapproval_preprocessing.csv` | Preprocessed dataset |
| `.github/workflows/model_retraining.yml` | GitHub Actions workflow configuration |
| `Dockerfile` | Container definition for model serving |
| `docker_hub_link.txt` | Reference to Docker Hub repository |
| `README.md` | Documentation of the CI workflow |
| `test_api.py` | Script to test the deployed model API |
| `GITHUB_SECRETS_GUIDE.md` | Guide for setting up required secrets |

## CI Workflow Stages

1. **Setup & Environment Preparation:**
   - Checkout repository
   - Configure Python environment
   - Install dependencies

2. **Model Training & Tracking:**
   - Run MLflow project with parameters
   - Track metrics and artifacts
   - Evaluate model performance

3. **Artifact Management:**
   - Upload model artifacts
   - Store metrics and visualizations

4. **Docker Deployment (Advanced):**
   - Build Docker image with model
   - Create Flask API for model serving
   - Push to Docker Hub

5. **Completion:**
   - Verify workflow completion
   - Log workflow results

## Testing

The implementation can be tested in these ways:

1. **Local Testing:**
   - Run MLflow project locally
   - Test model training and evaluation
   - Test Docker container locally

2. **CI Testing:**
   - Manually trigger GitHub Actions workflow
   - Monitor workflow execution
   - Verify artifact upload and Docker image

3. **API Testing:**
   - Deploy Docker container
   - Use test_api.py to verify endpoints
   - Test model predictions
