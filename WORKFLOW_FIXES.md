# Workflow Fixes Summary

This document outlines the changes made to fix the CI workflow issues.

## Key Issues Fixed

1. **MLflow Command Error (`--no-conda` option)**
   - Problem: The `--no-conda` flag was not supported in the installed MLflow version (2.19.0), causing workflow failure
   - Solution: Removed the `--no-conda` flag from the MLflow run command
   - Added fallback to run the Python script directly if MLflow run fails

2. **Path Structure in GitHub Actions**
   - Problem: The workflow was using incorrect paths: `${{ github.workspace }}/Workflow-CI/MLProject`
   - Solution: Updated all paths to use the correct GitHub Actions directory structure: `${{ github.workspace }}/MLProject`
   - Added debug steps to print directory contents for troubleshooting

3. **MLProject File Format Validation**
   - Added validation for the MLProject file format
   - Added auto-correction mechanism to ensure proper YAML syntax
   - Added fallback for missing conda.yaml file

4. **Artifact Handling**
   - Added safeguards to handle missing artifacts directories
   - Created placeholder model files if original model generation fails
   - Made the Docker build process more robust against missing files

5. **Improved Debugging**
   - Added verbose output for MLflow commands
   - Added directory listing for better visibility into repository structure
   - Added comprehensive error handling with meaningful messages

## Testing the Workflow

To test if the workflow fixes were successful:

1. Push these changes to your repository
2. Manually trigger the workflow using the GitHub Actions UI
3. Check the logs for each step to verify that:
   - The MLProject file is properly validated
   - The model training process runs successfully
   - The Docker image is built and pushed to Docker Hub (if on main branch)

## Future Improvements

- Consider adding unit tests for the model training script
- Add more granular error handling for specific MLflow errors
- Implement a notification system for failed workflow runs
- Add model performance comparison with previous runs
